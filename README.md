# Ooui.Samples
Sample demonstrating the use of SignalR within Xamarin forms inside of a WebAssembly using Ooui

## Windows Notes - 3/2018
*Ooui.AspNetCore.SignalR project won't restore packages on Windows / Visual Studio 2017 15.7.0 Preview 2
*Without some network changes, you'll have to run as administrator for the Ooui.WebAssembly project to be able to bind to port 8080

## Mac Notes
*Nothing so far
